# Milk_Quality_Prediction


Hello Everyone! 
This is a Data Visualization and Machine Learning based project in which we perform the Milk quality analysis and classification using different machine learning models. 
Good-quality raw milk has to be free of debris and sediment; free of off-flavours and abnormal colour and odour; low in bacterial count; free of chemicals (e.g., antibiotics, detergents); and of normal composition and acidity. The quality of raw milk is the primary factor determining the quality of milk products. The quality of milk is measured using a type of hydrometer called the lactometer. 
Additional Information: - A hydrometer is a type of instrument that measures the relative density of liquids based on buoyancy. They are generally calibrated and graduated with one or more scales like specific gravity.
According to Pehrsson [2], milk has around 87.80% water, 3.20% protein, 3.50% fat, 4.80% lactose, and 0.70% minerals and 100 gm milk supplies around 66 kcal of energy. While the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance (PMO) still uses 45 degrees Fahrenheit as a standard, we know that for quality products, that temperature is too high. As a rule of thumb, the colder we can store milk, the longer the shelf life and the better the quality.

This dataset consists of 7 independent variables ie pH, Temperature, Taste, Odor, Fat, Turbidity, and Color.
The target variable is nothing but the Grade of the milk. It can be Low (Bad), Medium (Moderate) or High (Good).

Models used:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier
Decision Tree Classifier
